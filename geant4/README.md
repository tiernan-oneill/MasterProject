# Geant4 Simulations and Analysis    

 We base our simulations off of the Geant4 extended example 'rdecay01'. Through the different
 edits we further change this example into our own build. 

### rdecay01_edit_1

 First edits to the rdecay01 example, for the study of the beta spectra of the isotopes.
  
### rdecay01_edit_2

 Further edits to the rdecay01 example, for the study of the real (or total) energy spectra of each isotope.
         	
### rdecay01_edit_3
 
 Final and largest edits to the rdecay01 example, for the study of hit counts of optical photons in the PMTs.
         	
### analysis

 All python scripts and jupyter notebooks of analysis of the outputs of the above three builds. These scripts 
 produce the different energy spectra found in the figures folders.
